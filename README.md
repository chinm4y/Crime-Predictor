# Crime-Predictor

This project employs classification algorithms in Python to analyze crime data and identify patterns that can help predict crime occurrences. Implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, it offers a clean and interactive environment to explore data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## üîç Project Overview

- Utilizes public crime datasets (e.g., city-level data, timestamps, locations)
- Applies machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Features engineered from spatiotemporal data (e.g. crime occurrence by time and location)

## üõ† Key Components

- **Crime-Predictor.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Feature engineering (date/time, location-based features)
  - Model training and comparison with performance metrics
  - Visualizations to highlight crime patterns and model effectiveness
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies used in the notebook

## üéØ Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (Time, Geolocation)
- Supervised Classification Models
